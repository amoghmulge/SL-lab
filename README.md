#### part-B

1. Introduction to Python: Write Python programs to do the following:
a) (partb_1a.py) Read a list of elements. Create a new list having all the elements minus the
duplicates (Use functions). Use one-line comprehensions of create a new list of 
28
even numbers. Create another list reversing the elements.
b) (partb_1b.py & endgame.txt) Write a python program to count the frequency of words in a given file.
c) (partb_1c.py) Read a list of numbers. Uses a recursive function to find the maximum of „n‟
numbers.
2. (partb_2.py) Introduction to Python Functions: Write a temperature converter python
program, which is menu driven. Each such conversion logic should be defined in
separate functions. The program should call the respective function based on the
user‟s requirement. The program should run as long as the user wishes so. Provide
an option to view the conversions stored as list of tuples with attributes - from unit
value, to unit value sorted by the user‟s choice (from-value or to-value).
3. (partb_3.py) Python Classes: Write a python class to reverse a sentence (initialized via
constructor) word by word. Example: “I am here” should be reversed as “here am
I”. Create instances of this class for each of the three strings input by the user and
display the reversed string for each, in descending order of number of vowels in the
string.
4. (partb_4.ipynb) Python for Data Science: Load TitanicDataset into one of the data structures
(NumPy or Pandas). Perform data pre-processing on this dataset. Create dataframes,
perform computations and visualize the results appropriately.
7. (partb_7.html) JavaScript – Client Side Validation: Design any two case studies that creates and
validates a HTML form at the client side using Javascript. Case Study examples
could be Grade Calculation from student marks entered, Bakery Menu & Price
calculation of items bought etc.
8. (partb_8.html) Introduction to JavaScript (JS): Dynamically loading JSON data - Implement a
HTML+JS application that has a JSON Array with details of different kinds of data.
Example: Model, Name, Price, Year. Display details of each vehicle dynamically by
only showing details of the vehicle that the user has selected (via mouse-over).
